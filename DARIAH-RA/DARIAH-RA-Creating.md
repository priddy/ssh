##Creating Resources
###Definition

This type of in-kind contribution describes the resources that an agent (institution, individual) creates in order to make them digitally available with the DARIAH community. In this context a “resource” is considered as an asset that supports a certain research activity (e.g. can be the digitized document that was not previously available or the training material to support an educational trajectory).

The resources can also have different forms for example:

-	Text
-	Images
-	Data (quantitative)
- 	Data (qualitative)
-	Video recording
-	Audio recording
-	Interactive resources (e.g. quizzes, interactive maps and diagrams etc.) 

If the resource proposed is code, its specificity will make it affiliated with the in-kind contribution “Development of software”.

###Enterprise Viewpoint 
The communities that form part of the **Creating Resources Community** and thus involved in this IKC are:

* **Data Creation Community:** the objective of the Data Creation Community is to create and/ or collect research data using specific instruments and methodologies.
Within DARIAH this community can be represented by the [cultural heritage institutions](./DARIAH-RA-Glossary.md#g-chi "glossary description of a cultural heritage institution") that make available digitally cultural object and/ or metadata of specific collections to researchers. It can also be represented by the organization of a conference that creates ancillary material to support the conference (e.g. abstracts) or by the training material created for an online course (e.g. test, readings etc.)

* **Data Management Community:** The main objective of the **Data Management Community** is to maintain or improve the quality of the research data for verification and reuse. In the context of this in-kind contribution, the data management community is involved only for what concerns the communication between the data creation community and the data management community about the appropriateness of the data created for its storage and for making sure that the data management community will take good care of the data. 

* **Data Provision Community:** the objective of the Data Provision Community is to disseminate and to provide access to the data. Their main objective is to make data accessible and discoverable. 

####Creating Resources Roles
The following roles have been identified as part of the Creating Resources Community.

-	**Data Creation Subsystem (passive role):** the community component representing the Creating Resources Community as a whole.
-	**Data Creator (active role):** agent responsible for the data creation
-	**Data Collector (active role):** the agent responsible for the collection of existing data
-	**Metadata Creator (active role):** the agent responsible for creating metadata related to the data examined, according to agreed metadata standards. 
-	**Data Manager (active role):** the agent responsible for communicating with the **Data Creator**, and maintaining the quality of the data on a technical perspective (keeping/improving it to defined quality/standards).
-	**Data Owner (active/passive role):** a person or organisation that owns the data and determines the conditions for deposit/access with the **Data Manager**.
-	**Data Provider (active role):** the agent responsible for making the data accessible and discoverable.
-	**Data Discovery System (passive role):** a system facilitating discovery of research data and its context.
-	**Data Consumer (active role):** an agent that requests and receives the research data (for further use).

####Creating Resources Behaviours

-	*Collect Data:* the behaviour of the **Data Creation Subsystem** performed by the **Data Collector** and the **Instrument** whereby the **Data Collector** records and aggregates observations from the **Instrument** into a dataset.  
-	*Curate Data:* the behaviour performed by the **Data Manager** whereby checks of the quality of the data are made and faults are removed. The **Data Manager** then adds meaningful documentation (metadata) to the data. 
-	*Data Publication:* A behaviour by the **Data Provider**, the **Data Discovery System** and the **Data Retrieval System** for making research data discoverable and accessible.
-	*Data Discovery:* a behaviour of the **Data Provider**, to making the created data discoverable and accessible. 

###Information Viewpoint 
*Data*

-	*Data Object Type:* (e.g. digitized cultural object or training material for a course): the minimum available information object type that can be shared from the data creator to the data consumer
-	*Metadata Object Type:* the information object type that describes and contextualizes the data object type

*Agents*

-	*Data Owner:* the agent who ultimately owns the data
-	*Data Creator:* the agent who creates the data
-	*Data Collector:* the agent who collects already existing data, creating new type of resources
-	*Data Manager:* the agent who makes sure that the data/ resources are of good quality
-	*Data consumer:* the agents who accesses the data created

*Services*

-	*Digitization service:* information object type that translates the analogue object type into a data object type

*Contracts*  

In this case (creating resources) the use of a standard might be crucial in the harmonization of the data and metadata of a research or heritage institution. The agreement and eventually the contract for this in-kind is represented by the agreement between the resource owner and the data creator (in the sense of digitisation) if they are two different agents. Another agreement can be thought in the case of teaching material between students and teacher, where the agreement  is about the students studying/ reading the material.

Case Study: Creation of linguistic data 
</th></tr>
<tr><td>
[EASY](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl "EASY archiving system homepage") is the data archive for the social science and humanities in the Netherlands. Such data archive has been developed and is currently maintained and enriched by [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/front-page?set_language=en "DANS homepage in English"), an institute of the [Dutch Royal Academy of Science](https://knaw.nl/en?set_language=en "KNAW homepage in English"), that has a leading role (nationally and internationally) in the development of data quality policies and research data management plans. 

As such, EASY offers to the research community the possibility to host their data after they have finished their research and therefore can be considered as a candidate for a DARIAH contribution [**Data Hosting Service**](./DARIAH-RA-Hosting.md "Data Hosting Service IKC architecture") 

In terms of Enterprise Viewpoint, the **Data Hosting Community** is represented by the DANS team, which is the community who acquires, administers and curates the dataset created by the Resources Creation Community (the researcher depositing the datasets). The team at DANS acquires the data (with the support of a submission agreement) through the submission of information packages. 

To all the archived data, DANS applies the principles of the Preservation Policies Data Archiving and Networked Services, which draws the lines of the agreement between the Data Hosting Community and the Resource Creation Community. 

In terms of information Viewpoint, the research outputs and the data delivered to EASY in order to be archived are the main information object type for this type of contribution. According to the recommendation of DANS, the data need to be structured according a series of preferred data and metadata formats and they need to include reference to their accessibility and reuse possibility. A contract (another data object type) will then establish duties and rights for the Data Hosting Community and the Data Resource Community by answering questions like: for how long will the data be maintained? what are the responsibilities of the stakeholders involved?
