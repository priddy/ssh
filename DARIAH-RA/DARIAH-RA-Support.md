##Support Service
###Definition
Support services are designed to help for the use of a tool or a service. They also contribute to the update and maintenance for a service an institution provides. 
This type of contribution includes helpdesks (services charged to answer requests from the users). It can be an automated helpdesk (email address).
On a second level, support services can be the components helping to maintain the configuration for a software. It can be human support, on the base of a service level agreement, or a helpdesk providing the information for the maintenance of a service.
