###Enterprise Viewpoint
####Communities
The “Event” in-kind contribution comprises the following communities: 

* **Outreach, Training & Support Community:** who provides community services to the SSH research community. They interact with the **Data Infrastructure community** for developing standards or for providing training for, or about, the data infrastructure community. This community is not directly involved in the data creation process, but it rather disseminates and gives training on the data developed and processed. 


####Event Activity Roles
The following roles within the **Outreach, Training & Support Community** have been identified:

* **Event Activity Subsystem (passive role):** the community component representing the **Outreach, Training & Support (Event) Community:**
-	**Event Owner (active/passive role):** the agent who initiates and is responsible for the event; it can be an individual or the organization
-	**Event Host (active role):** institution agent hosting the event 
-	**Event Manager (active role):** the agent who supervises the organization of the event  on a daily basis in view of its successful outcome 
-	**Event Deliverer (active role):** the agent who delivers the event, (e.g. a conference or an academic course)
-	**Event Participant (active role):** the agent who attends the event or training
-	**Event Support (active role):** the agent who provides support with organizational aspects of the event or training
-	**Event Documentation System (passive role):** written/audio-visual/multimedia materials that accompanies the event or the training material provided in support of a training event.
-	**Event Registration System (active role):** the system that facilitates the registration of the participants to the event. 
-	**Event Assessor (active role):** the agent who i.e. assesses the papers, abstract for the conference or assesses the test at the end of the course; in training, i.e. the assessor assesses the quality of the outcomes and may give a certificate
-	**Event Assessment System (passive/active role):** the community component representing the event assessment 

####Event Activity Behaviours
The following behaviours are examples as there are too many possible behaviours for the range of possible event IKCs to all be listed here. These here are for a Digital Hummanities event.

* *Paper submission:* the behaviour of the **Event Deliverer**, who submits a proposal to be presented at the DH event. 
* *Registration of attendee:* the behaviour of the **Event Participant**, who register for the event via the **Event Registration System** in order to attend the event itself.
3.	*Running the Event:* the behaviour of the **Event Manager**, who makes sure that the event runs smoothly and according to the programme
4.	*(Post Event activities):* the behaviour of a number of stakeholders (**Event Manager**, **Event Host** and **Event Owner**) that reflect on the organised event, focussing in particular on the successes and failures. 

###Information Viewpoint
This paragraph provides an overview of the category type: “event” from an Information Viewpoint. 

*Data*
Information that is used as support or training material during an event (including training event).  The data can consist of research outputs, both in the form of raw data or publications, standardized in order to describe consistently the observation and analysis. 
Data information objects can be content objects (observation, concepts and metadata) or container objects (dataset, inventory). 

*Agents*

-	*Event Owner:* the agent who initiates and is responsible for the event; it can be an individual or the organization
-	*Event Host:* institution hosting the event 
-	*Event Manager:* the agent who supervises the organization of the event  on a daily basis in view of its successful outcome 
-	*Event Deliverer:* the agent who delivers the event, (e.g. a conference or an academic course)
-	*Event Participant:* the agent who attends the event or training
-	*Event Support:* the agent who provides support with organizational aspects of the event or training
-	*Event Documentation System:* written material that accompanies the event or the training material provided in support of a training
-	*Event Registration System:* the system that allows the registration of the participants to the event 
-	*Event Assessor:* the agent who i.e. assesses the papers, abstract for the conference // or assesses the test at the end of the training; in training, i.e. the assessor assesses the quality of the outcomes and maybe gives a certificate
-	*Event Assessment System:* the community component representing the event assessment 

*Service*

-	*Information material about the event:* advertising, but also training material distributed to support the behaviour of the event deliverer
-	*Event Support:* support during the organization of the event

*Contract*

-	*Standards:* standards that exist between a community (e.g. a certain standard use in a exercise during the training) 
-	*Access conditions:* access conditions that regulate the participation to the event
-	*Attendance Certificate:* the certificate that proves the participation of an attendee to the event
-  *Support Contract:* A contract with a support (suplier) agent to provides organizational aspects of the event (e.g. catering, equipment hire, equipment support etc.)

Case Study - DH2016 Conference
</th></tr>
<tr><td>
An event is a system instantiated by an **Event Owner**. The DH2016 conference was held in Krakow and organized jointly by a Programme Committee (international) and a local Organization Team. The local organization team also acts as the **Event Manager**, supervising the successful outcome of the Event Activity. 
The **Event Documentation System** includes written material that accompanies the event (brochure, maps, abstracts). One important aspect of such big event as the DH2016 is represented by the **Event Registration System**. The **Event Assessment System** is also very important and comprises one or more **Event Assessors**, who are responsible for assessing and accepting the proposals submitted. 
The **Event Participants** are the conference attendees, while the **Event Deliverer** are the people presenting at the conference.
