Case Study
A DARIAH institution offers a contribution. 
</th></tr>
<tr><td>
The institute fills a self-assessment and submits it via the Contribution Tool. The assessment criteria are provided by the tool. Assessment criteria are offered for each type of contribution. 
This self-assessment is peer reviewed by the appropriate peer review group via the tool, composed of VCC Heads and members of the Working Groups. When the VCC Heads peer-review in-kind contributions, they act as **Coordination Activity Implementer**. The **Coordination Activity Provider** is the peer-reviewing group (composed of VCC heads and Working groups members). It acts on the behalf of DARIAH, which is the **Coordination Activity Owner**. The **Coordination Activity Consumer** is also DARIAH, since it will be the beneficiary of the expertise of this group to review in-kind contributions. The **Coordination Activity Subsystem** is represented by the Contribution Tool. DARIAH and the VCC belong the **DARIAH Coordination Community**.
