#DARIAH Integrated Service References Architecture
#Glossary
**Activity:** In general terms, an activity can be described as one or a set of actions, performed by an agent (single or institution) in order to achieve a result or product that can be shared with another agent. Differently from a service, an activity is discrete, as it is marked by a beginning and an end.

**Archival Information Package:** The definition of the term Archival Storage in OAIS includes the services and functions necessary for the storage of the Archival Information Package (AIP). Archival storage encompasses data management and includes processes such as storage media selection, transfer of AIP to storage system, data security and validity, backup and data restoration, and reproduction of AIP to new media [IASA](https://www.iasa-web.org/tc04/archival-information-package-aip "International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives"). It is described fully in the [Recommendation for Space Data System Practices RM-OAIS](https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf "The Consultative Committtee for Space Data Systems, Magenta Book") 

Cultural Heritage Object: analogue and original physical object or its digital representation of an artefacts from a cultural heritage institution 

Cultural Heritage Institution: Institution that preserves the cultural heritage objects and that makes available digitally cultural object and/ or metadata of specific collections to researchers.

**DARIAH-EU - Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts and Humanities:** DARIAH is a European research infrastructure (ERIC).  It connects several hundreds of scholars and dozens of research facilities in currently 17 european countries, the DARIAH member countries. People in DARIAH provide digital tools and share data as well as know-how. They organize learning opportunities for digital research methods, like workshops and summer schools, and offer training materials for the Digital Humanities. <https://www.dariah.eu/>

Data: digitized version of an existing object (when referred to a cultural heritage object); it can be research data (input or outcome of research, conducted through digital means); it can be information (e.g. data about a certain topic, which can be collected and stored)

Data Hosting Community: equivalent to the Data Management Community in the RM-SSH Enterprise Viewpoint

<a id="g-eric"></a>
**ERIC:** The European Research Infrastructure Consortium is a legal framework to facilitate international research infrastructural collaborations to become established and operate as a legal entity (legal person). <https://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index.cfm?pg=eric>

<a id="g-has"></a>
**HaS - Humanities at Scale:** Humanities at Scale (HaS) can be understood as an add on to DARIAH. It is set up to improve DARIAH in fostering new and sustaining existing knowledge in digitally enabled research in the arts and humanities. <http://has.dariah.eu/?page_id=7>

Information object: Information objects model the data about entities in the real world, their state and behaviour and interactions with other information objects. An information object has a type that share a common set of features and behaviours (RM- SSH, DASISH)

Information object type: The information types are identified from an inventory of the communities. These were then abstracted to common information types that are independent of the communities into four categories: Data, Agent, Service and Contract. 

<a id="g-ingest"></a>
**Ingest:** in the OAIS model, is the process that accepts the data object and all its related metadata (SIP), verifies the file, extracts the relevant data, prepares the archival information package (AIP) for storage, and ensures that AIPs and their supporting descriptive information become established within the repository. <https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf>

<a id-"g-ikc"></a>
**In-kind Contribution (IKC):** Is the provision of goods or services to an organisation by one of its members, valued in monetary terms according to rules agreed upon beforehand by the members of the organisation, and accounted for as part of the member’s contribution to the budget. 

Knowledge transfer: act of sharing and disseminating knowledge from one organisation to another, or from one field of expertise to another.

Metadata: Metadata is additional data about an informational object and can be "descriptive" or "structural" in nature. A standard is normally employed to define the form of the metadata takes.

OAI-PMH: The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. It is a protocol developed for harvesting (or collecting) metadata descriptions of records in an archive so that services can be built using metadata from many archives. An implementation of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in Dublin Core, but may also support additional representations.

**OAIS / Reference Model for an Open Archival Information Systems:** is a conceptual framework for an archival system used for long-term preservation and access to digital information. It is described in the [Recommendation for Space Data System Practices RM-OAIS](https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf "The Consultative Committtee for Space Data Systems, Magenta Book")

<a id="g-oom"></a>
**Object-Oriented Modeling (OOM):** 
is an approach to modeling an application, environment, or infrastructure that is used to determine the functionality the system is to provide without consideration of implementation constraints to create abstract descriptions of processes and objects that define their essential structure and behavior. This abstract description can be refine it into an implementable design (and where appropriate software code). A key goal of the Object-Oriented approach is to decrease the "semantic gap" between the system and the real world, using terminology that is the same as the functions that are performed. 
Object modelling is often used for process modelling of a dynamic system but can also be used to describe the components of a static structure or system. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_modeling>

<a id="g-ra"></a>
**Reference Architecture (RA):** Models and standardises the abstract elements in the domain of interest independent of the technologies, protocols, and products that are used to implement a specific solution for the domain. For more information: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_architecture>.

<a id="g-rm"></a>
**Reference Model (RM):** An archetectural abstract framework (or domain-specific ontology) for understanding significant relationships among the entities of some environment. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_model>

Resource Creation Community: equivalent to the Data Creation Community in the RM-SSH Enterprise Viewpoint


Research Infrastructure (RI): distributed organisation which provides services (e.g. tools, hosting, processing, archiving, displaying data), access to research data and community support for researchers. 

Research Object: Research data part of a scientific investigation. It can be identified (DOI), described (metadata) and aggregated. 

<a id="g-rmssh:></a>
**RM-SSH (Reference Model for Social Science and Humanities Data Infrastructures):** The reference model describes the concepts and relations of social sciences and/or humanities data infrastructures. <https://sites.google.com/a/dans.knaw.nl/reference-model-for-ssh-data-infrastructure/home>

Service: a service can be described as one or multiple objects, systems or activities that an agent makes available to another agent, in order to enable the service using agent to perform a specific activity. 

<a id="g-soa"></a>
**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):**
A service-oriented architecture is essentially a collection of services, which communicate with each other. The communication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more services coordinating some activity. Some means of connecting services to each other is required; a service request from the service consumer and a service response from the service provider.
<https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMQ79_9.5.1/com.ibm.egl.pg.doc/topics/pegl_serv_overview.html>

Service Provider: An organisation or group, whom together, provide a specific service for a designated community.

Service Consumer: an agent that requests, receives and utilises a service. 

Software: programming interfaces used in order to produce code. 

<a id="g-sip"></a>
**Submission Information Package (SIP):** is a package delivered to the digital storage system for ingest. The SIP includes the data object to be stored and all the necessary related metadata about the object and its content. It is described in the [Recommendation for Space Data System Practices RM-OAIS](https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/650x0m2.pdf "The Consultative Committtee for Space Data Systems, Magenta Book")

<a id="g-vpm"></a>
**Viewpoint Modelling:** uses a framework which defines a coherent set of views to be used in the construction of an architecture of a complex system. A viewpoint is a representation of the whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. By interlinking the viewpoints, a complete description of the system emerges from a high-level viewpoint to a detailed specific viewpoint.
